# Image Captioning with CNN Encoder and LSTM Decoder

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of training an image captioning model using the COCO 2017 dataset. It employs a CNN encoder and an LSTM decoder to generate captions for images.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the image captioning model is evaluated using the BLEU score.
